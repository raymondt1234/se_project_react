# WTWR (What to Wear?): Front End

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Functionality

* Sign up and add clothing items and categorize them as Hot, Warm, or Cold
* Logged in users can delete clothing items they have added 
* Logged in users can like clothing items of any user
* The main page shows current date, location (currently hard coded to Maricopa, AZ), and the clothing items that are most appropriate for the weather
* Users can click on clothing items on the main page and view the weather category for the item
* On the main page there is a switch to change the temperature scale from fahrenheit to celsius
* Users can change their user name and avatar
